  abstract = {The hierarchical structure of bone, involving micro-scale organization and interaction of material components, is a critical determinant of macro-scale mechanics. Changes in whole-bone morphology in response to the actions of individual genes, physiological loading during life, or evolutionary processes, may be accompanied by alterations in underlying mineralization or architecture. Here, we used nanoindentation to precisely measure compressive stiffness in the femoral mid-diaphysis of mice that had experienced 37 generations of selective breeding for high levels of voluntary wheel running (HR). Mice (n = 48 total), half from HR lines and half from non-selected control (C) lines, were divided into two experimental groups, one with 13-14 weeks of access to a running wheel and one housed without wheels (n = 12 in each group). At the end of the experiment, gross and micro-computed tomography (microCT)-based morphometric traits were measured, and reduced elastic modulus (E(r)) was estimated separately for four anatomical quadrants of the femoral cortex: anterior, posterior, lateral, and medial. Two-way, mixed-model analysis of covariance (ancova) showed that body mass was a highly significant predictor of all morphometric traits and that structural change is more apparent at the microCT level than in conventional morphometrics of whole bones. Both line type (HR vs. C) and presence of the mini-muscle phenotype (caused by a Mendelian recessive allele and characterized by a approximately 50\% reduction in mass of the gastrocnemius muscle complex) were significant predictors of femoral cortical cross-sectional anatomy. Measurement of reduced modulus obtained by nanoindentation was repeatable within a single quadrant and sensitive enough to detect inter-individual differences. Although we found no significant effects of line type (HR vs. C) or physical activity (wheel vs. no wheel) on mean stiffness, anterior and posterior quadrants were significantly stiffer (P \ensuremath{<} 0.0001) than medial and lateral quadrants (32.67 and 33.09 GPa vs. 29.78 and 30.46 GPa, respectively). Our findings of no significant difference in compressive stiffness in the anterior and posterior quadrants agree with previous results for mice, but differ from those for large mammals. Integrating these results with others from ongoing research on these mice, we hypothesize that the skeletons of female HR mice may be less sensitive to the effects of chronic exercise, due to decreased circulating leptin levels and potentially altered endocannabinoid signaling.},

  doi = {10.1002/ajpa.21286},
  abstract = {Limb bone diaphyseal structure is frequently used to infer hominin activity levels from skeletal remains, an approach based on the well-documented ability of bone to adjust to its loading environment during life. However, diaphyseal structure is also determined in part by genetic factors. This study investigates the possibility that genetic variation underlying diaphyseal structure is influenced by the activity levels of ancestral populations and might also have functional significance in an evolutionary context. We adopted an experimental evolution approach and tested for differences in femoral diaphyseal structure in 1-week-old mice from a line that had been artificially selected (45 generations) for high voluntary wheel running and non-selected controls. As adults, selected mice are significantly more active on wheels and in home cages, and have thicker diaphyses. Structural differences at 1 week can be assumed to primarily reflect the effects of selective breeding rather than direct mechanical stimuli, given that the onset of locomotion in mice is shortly after Day 7. We hypothesized that if genetically determined diaphyseal structure reflects the activity patterns of members of a lineage, then selected animals will have relatively larger diaphyseal dimensions at 1 week compared to controls. The results provide strong support for this hypothesis and suggest that limb bone cross sections may not always only reflect the activity levels of particular fossil individuals, but also convey an evolutionary signal providing information about hominin activity in the past.},

  abstract = {Both genetic and environmental factors are known to influence the structure of bone, contributing to its mechanical behavior during, and adaptive response to, loading. We introduce a novel approach to simultaneously address the genetically mediated, exercise-related effects on bone morphometrics and strength, using mice that had been selectively bred for high levels of voluntary wheel running (16 generations). Female mice from high running and control lines were either allowed (n=12, 12, respectively) or denied (n=11, 12, respectively) access to wheels for 20 months. Femoral shaft, neck, and head were measured with calipers and via micro-computed tomography. Fracture characteristics of the femoral head were assessed in cantilever bending. After adjusting for variation in body mass by two-way analysis of covariance, distal width of the femur increased as a result of selective breeding, and mediolateral femoral diameter was reduced by wheel access. Cross-sectional area of the femoral mid-shaft showed a significant linetype x activity effect, increasing with wheel access in high-running lines but decreasing in control lines. Body mass was significantly positively correlated with many of the morphometric traits studied. Fracture load of the femoral neck was strongly positively predicted by morphometric traits of the femoral neck (r2\ensuremath{>}0.30), but no significant effects of selective breeding or wheel access were found. The significant correlations of body mass with femoral morphometric traits underscore the importance of controlling for body size when analyzing the response of bone size and shape to experimental treatments. After controlling for body mass, measures of the femoral neck remain significant predictors of femoral neck strength.},

  abstract = {Background/Aims: Wing skeletons of bats are uniquely specialized for flight, reflecting both evolutionary history and the need to maintain structural integrity while generating aerodynamic forces. Methods: We analyzed the anatomical structure of bat wing skeletons in the context of scaling patterns relative to other mammals, material properties and the mechanical function of the wing bones during flight. Results: Compared with nonvolant mammals, the bones of the bat forelimb are elongated, even after correcting for shared phylogenetic history. Bats have consistently larger-diameter bones in the forelimb than do nonvolant mammals but significantly narrower hindlimb bones. Mineralization in the cortical bone of wings is lower than in the long bones of other adult mammals, with a proximodistal gradient of decreasing mineralization. The distal phalanges have only a small amount of mineralized tissue underlying the articular cartilage. Loads required to elicit a 10\% length deflection in the wing bones of Glossophaga soricina varied approximately 50-fold along the wing and flexural stiffness nearly 200-fold. Commensurate with low mineralization and flexural stiffness, bat bones experience extraordinarily high bending strains during flight. Conclusion: Bat limb skeletons share features with other mammals and possess specialized characteristics, mostly related to the mechanical demands of flight. Copyright (C) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

  volume = {213},
  doi = {10.1242/jeb.043091},
  abstract = {In this study we compared the wing kinematics of 27 bats representing six pteropodid species ranging more than 40 times in body mass (M(b)=0.0278-1.152 kg), to determine whether wing posture and overall wing kinematics scaled as predicted according to theory. The smallest species flew in a wind tunnel and the other five species in a flight corridor. Seventeen kinematic markers on the midline and left side of the body were tracked in three dimensions. We used phylogenetically informed reduced major axis regression to test for allometry. We found that maximum wingspan (b(max)) and maximum wing area (S(max)) scaled with more positive allometry, and wing loading (Q(s)) with more negative allometry (b(max)\ensuremath{\propto}M(b)(0.423); S(max)\ensuremath{\propto}M(b)(0.768); Q(s)\ensuremath{\propto}M(b)(0.233)) than has been reported in previous studies that were based on measurements from specimens stretched out flat on a horizontal surface. Our results suggest that larger bats open their wings more fully than small bats do in flight, and that for bats, body measurements alone cannot be used to predict the conformation of the wings in flight. Several kinematic variables, including downstroke ratio, wing stroke amplitude, stroke plane angle, wing camber and Strouhal number, did not change significantly with body size, demonstrating that many aspects of wing kinematics are similar across this range of body sizes. Whereas aerodynamic theory suggests that preferred flight speed should increase with mass, we did not observe an increase in preferred flight speed with mass. Instead, larger bats had higher lift coefficients (C(L)) than did small bats (C(L)\ensuremath{\propto}M(b)(0.170)). Also, the slope of the wingbeat period (T) to body mass regression was significantly more shallow than expected under isometry (T\ensuremath{\propto}M(b)(0.180)), and angle of attack (\ensuremath{\alpha}) increased significantly with body mass {[}\ensuremath{{\alpha}{\propto}}log(M(b))7.738{]}. None of the bats in our study flew at constant speed, so we used multiple regression to isolate the changes in wing kinematics that correlated with changes in flight speed, horizontal acceleration and vertical acceleration. We uncovered several significant trends that were consistent among species. Our results demonstrate that for medium- to large-sized bats, the ways that bats modulate their wing kinematics to produce thrust and lift over the course of a wingbeat cycle are independent of body size.},

  abstract = {This study examined the day-to-day variability in voluntary wheel-running behavior among three genetically distinct lines of young male and female mice. Daily wheel revolutions were recorded at an age of 6-8 weeks in 10 males and 10 females from each of 3 lines: selectively bred line for high wheel running (Line 8), selectively bred for high wheel-running activity and fixed for a Mendelian recessive allele that reduces hind-limb muscle mass by 50\% (Line 3), non-selected control (Line 2). There were significant mean differences in revolutions/day among weeks (P = 0.003), but the effect size was small (10\%). Significant main effects for wheel running were also revealed for sex and line (P \ensuremath{<} 0.001). The grand mean +/- SD for the coefficient of variation (CV) of intra-individual wheel running was 23.0 +/- 10.8\%. Although a significant main effect for the CV was found for week, the effect size was low (7\%) (age 6 weeks, 23.4 +/- 10.9\%; age 7 weeks, 25.1 +/- 13.2\%; age 8 weeks, 20.1 +/- 7.8\%). The overall mean CV was similar between females (21.4 +/- 9.8\%) and males (24.4 +/- 12.0\%) and among lines (Line 2, 23.4 +/- 9.8\%; Line 3, 20.4 +/- 7.6\%; and Line 8, 25.0 +/- 14.4\%). These findings are consistent with our previous work in young humans and lend further support for the hypothesis that biological mechanisms influence daily levels of physical activity.},

Primitively, the hallux of nonavian theropod dinosaurs was unreversed and lay parallel to digits II-IV. Among basal birds, a unique digital innovation evolved in which the hallux opposes digits II-IV. This digital configuration is critical for grasping and perching. I studied skeletons of modern birds with a range of hallucal designs, from unreversed (anteromedially directed) to fully reversed (posteriorly directed). Two primary correlates of hallucal orientation were revealed. First, the fossa into which metatarsal I articulates is oriented slightly more posteriorly on the tarsometatarsus, rotating the digit as a unit. Second, metatarsal I exhibits a distinctive torsion of its distal shaft relative to its proximal articulation with the tarsometatarsus, reorienting the distal condyles and phalanges of digit I. Herein, I present a method that facilitates the re-evaluation of hallucal orientation in fossil avians based on morphology alone. This method also avoids potential misinterpretations of hallucal orientation in fossil birds that could result from preserved appearance alone.},

To create a population suitable for mapping the genomic location of the MM allele and to better characterize its pleiotropic effects, we crossed females fixed for the MM allele with male C57BL/6J. F(1) males were then backcrossed to the MM parent females. Backcross (BC) mice (N = 404) were dissected, and a 50:50 ratio of normal to MM phenotype was observed with no overlap in relative muscle mass. In the BC, analysis of covariance revealed that MM individuals ran significantly more on days 5 and 6 of a 6-day exposure to running wheels (as in the routine selective-breeding protocol), were smaller in body mass, and had larger ventricles and spleens.},

  abstract = {Exercise is a naturally rewarding behaviour in human beings and can be associated with feelings of euphoria and analgesia. The endocannabinoid system may play a role in the perception of neurobiological rewards during and after prolonged exercise. Mice from lines that have been selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running (high runner or HR lines) may have evolved neurobiological mechanisms that increase the incentive salience of endurance-type exercise. Here, we test the hypothesis that endocannabinoid signalling has been altered in the four replicate HR lines as compared with four nonselected control lines. After 18 days of acclimation to cages with attached wheels, we injected mice with rimonabant (SR141716), a selective cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist. During the time of normal peak running, each mouse received, in a randomized order, intraperitoneal injection of rimonabant (0.1 or 3.0 mg/kg) or vehicle, over 9 days. Drug response was quantified as wheel revolutions, time and speed 10-70 min postinjection. Rimonabant decreased running in all mice; however, female HR mice differentially decreased running speed and distance (but not time) as compared with control females. We conclude that altered endocannabinoid signalling plays a role in the high wheel running of female HR mice.},

Mice from four replicate lines bred for high voluntary wheel running (HR lines) run almost three times as much as four non-selected control (C) lines, and exhibit two fold elevated baseline circulating corticosterone levels throughout the 24 h cycle. Although elevated baseline CORT may be beneficial for high locomotor activity, chronic elevations can have deleterious effects on multiple systems, and may predispose for affective disorders. Because stressful events often precede a depressive bout, we quantified depressive-like behavior in the forced-swim (FST; generation 41) and tail-suspension tests (TST; generation 47) in HR and C mice that had wheel access for 6 days and then were deprived of wheels on day seven prior to the FST or TST. Male HR spent significantly more time immobile in the FST than C, suggesting that HR males have a predisposition for depression-like behavior. Both male and female HR (generation 43) were more active than same-sex controls in both wheel running and home-cage activity across 22 h (pooling the sexes, HR/C = 2.28 and 2.66, respectively).},

  abstract = {Voluntary activity is a complex trait, comprising both behavioral (motivation, reward) and anatomical/physiological (ability) elements. In the present study, oxygen transport was investigated as a possible limitation to further increases in running by four replicate lines of mice that have been selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running and have reached an apparent selection limit. To increase oxygen transport capacity, erythrocyte density was elevated by the administration of an erythropoietin (EPO) analogue. Mice were given two EPO injections, two days apart, at one of two dose levels (100 or 300 microg kg(-1)). Hemoglobin concentration ({[}Hb{]}), maximal aerobic capacity during forced treadmill exercise (VO2,max) and voluntary wheel running were measured. {[}Hb{]} did not differ between high runner (HR) and non-selected control (C) lines without EPO treatment. Both doses of EPO significantly (P\ensuremath{<}0.0001) increased {[}Hb{]} as compared with sham-injected animals, with no difference in {[}Hb{]} between the 100 microg kg(-1) and 300 microg kg(-1) dose levels (overall mean of 4.5 g dl(-1) increase). EPO treatment significantly increased VO2,max by approximately 5\% in both the HR and C lines, with no dosexline type interaction. However, wheel running (revolutions per day) did not increase with EPO treatment in either the HR or C lines, and in fact significantly decreased at the higher dose in both line types. These results suggest that neither {[}Hb{]} per se nor VO2,max is limiting voluntary wheel running in the HR lines. Moreover, we hypothesize that the decrease in wheel running at the higher dose of EPO may reflect direct action on the reward pathway of the brain.},

Using entomological radar, we showed that the ability to select seasonally favorable, high-altitude winds is widespread in large day- and night-flying migrants and that insects adopt optimal flight headings that partially correct for crosswind drift, thus maximizing distances traveled. Trajectory analyses show that these behaviors increase migration distances by 40\% and decrease the degree of drift from seasonally optimal directions. These flight behaviors match the sophistication of those seen in migrant birds and help explain how high-flying insects migrate successfully between seasonal habitats.},

Analysis of variance indicated significant differences among C lines but not among HR for revolutions per day. By contrast, average speed varied significantly among HR lines, but not among C, and showed a sex-by-linetype interaction, with the HR/C ratio being 2.02 for males and 2.45 for females. Time spent running varied among both HR and C lines, and showed a sex-by-linetype interaction, with the HR/C ratio being 1.52 for males but only 1.17 for females. Thus, females (speed) and males (speed, but also time) evolved differently, as did the replicate selected lines. Speed and time showed a trade-off among HR but not among C lines. These results demonstrate that uniform selection on a complex trait can cause consistent responses in the trait under direct selection while promoting divergence in the lower-level components of that trait.},

  abstract = {The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is involved in regulation of various physiological functions, including locomotion, antinociception, emotional states, and motivated behaviors. The ECS has been implicated in regulation of voluntary wheel running in mice via actions at the cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1). Previously, we showed that four replicate lines of mice bred for high levels of voluntary wheel running (high-runner or HR lines) sex-specifically (females only) decreased running in response to antagonism of the CB1 receptor, as compared with four unselected Control lines. Here, we administered a CB1 receptor agonist, WIN 55,212-2 (WIN). We predicted that if CB1 activation is involved in the regulation of voluntary wheel running, then HR mice would show a greater response to CB1 agonism. Following our previous protocols, mice from generation 53 were acclimated to running wheels for 24 days, then received, in random order, either an intra-peritoneal injection of vehicle or a low (0.5 mg/kg), medium (1 mg/kg) or high dosage (3 mg/kg) of WIN. Each mouse received an injection and then experienced two nights without injections, for a total period of 12 days. Response to WIN was quantified as wheel revolutions, time spent running, and average running speed in the 10-120 min immediately following injection. Injection decreased wheel revolutions in all mice, but male HR mice decreased their running to a greater degree relative to Controls in response to the high dose of WIN over the entire period analyzed, whereas HR females showed a differential response relative to Controls only in the latter 70-120 min post-injection. These results, in conjunction with our previous study, show that (a) aspects of endocannabinoid signaling have diverged in four lines of mice bred for high levels of voluntary exercise and (b) male and female HR mice differ from one another in CB1 signaling as it relates to wheel running.},

  doi = {10.1242/jeb.075044},
  abstract = {The biomechanical and neuromuscular mechanisms used by different animals to generate turns in flight are highly variable. Body size and body plan exert some influence, e.g., birds typically roll their body to orient forces generated by the wings whereas insects are capable of turning via left-right wingbeat asymmetries. Turns are also relatively brief and have low repeatability with almost every wingbeat serving a different function throughout the change in heading. Here we present an analysis of Anna's hummingbirds (Calypte anna) as they fed continuously from an artificial feeder revolving around the outside of the animal. This setup allowed for examination of sustained changes in yaw without requiring any corresponding changes in pitch, roll, or body position. Hummingbirds sustained yaw turns by expanding the wing stroke amplitude of the outer wing during the downstroke and by altering the deviation of the wingtip path during both downstroke and upstroke. The latter led to a shift in the inner-outer stroke plane angle during the upstroke and shifts in the elevation of the stroke plane and in the deviation of the wingtip path during both strokes. These features are generally more similar to how insects, as opposed to birds, turn. However, time series analysis also revealed considerable stroke-to-stroke variation. Changes in the stroke amplitude and the wingtip velocity were highly cross-correlated as were changes in the stroke deviation and the elevation of the stroke plane. As was the case for wingbeat kinematics, electromyogram recordings from pectoral and wing muscles were highly variable, but no correlations were found between these two features of motor control. The high variability of both kinematic and muscle activation features indicates a high level of wingbeat-to-wingbeat adjustments during sustained yaw. The activation timing of the muscles was more repeatable than the activation intensity, which suggests that the former may be constrained by harmonic motion and that the latter may play a large role in kinematic adjustments. Comparing the revolution frequency of the feeder to measurements of free flight yaws reveals that feeder tracking, even at one revolution every two seconds, is well below the maximum yaw capacity of the hummingbirds.},
