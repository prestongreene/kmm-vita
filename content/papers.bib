abstract = {Energy systems models are important methods used to generate a range of insight and analysis on the supply and demand of energy. Developed over the second half of the twentieth century, they are now seeing increased relevance in the face of stringent climate policy, energy security and economic development concerns, and increasing challenges due to the changing nature of the twenty-first century energy system. In this paper, we look particularly at models relevant to national and international energy policy, grouping them into four categories: energy systems optimization models, energy systems simulation models, power systems and electricity market models, and qualitative and mixed-methods scenarios. We examine four challenges they face and the efforts being taken to address them: (1) resolving time and space, (2) balancing uncertainty and transparency, (3) addressing the growing complexity of the energy system, and (4) integrating human behavior and social risks and opportunities. In discussing these challenges, we present possible avenues for future research and make recommendations to ensure the continued relevance for energy systems models as important sources of information for policy-making.

An innovative framework for quantifying the combined governance of cities and energy systems is presented before focusing on a detailed study of London, Paris, Berlin and Copenhagen. By applying an optimization model to assess the lowest cost technology pathways to achieve emission reduction targets, the links between the governance of urban energy systems and the cost of achieving carbon targets are shown. Additionally a novel metric of scenario similarity is introduced in order to evaluate the diculty of hypothesized energy system transitions. The results indicate that these tools can be valuable in identifying similar cities for the sharing of best practice, for performing comparative evaluations of energy transitions, and for reinforcing the need to complement quantitative assessments with a more holistic appreciation of local context.},

abstract = {Modern cities depend on energy systems to deliver a range of services such as heating, cooling, lighting, mobility, communications, and so on. This article examines how these urban energy systems came to be, tracing the major transitions from the earliest settlements through to today's fossil-fuelled cities. The underlying theme is âincreasing efficiency under constraintsâ with each transition marked by increasing energy efficiency in service provision, increasing per capita energy use, increasing complexity in the energy system's structure, with innovations driven by a strategic view of the overall system, and accompanied by wider changes in technology and society. In developed countries, the future of urban energy systems is likely to continue many of these trends, with increased efficiency being driven by the constraints of climate change and rising fuel prices. Both supply and demand side technologies are discussed as potential solutions to these issues, with different impacts on the urban environment and its citizens. However in developing countries, rising urban populations and access to basic energy services will drive the next transition.},

abstract = {Energy use in cities has attracted significant research in recent years. However such a broad topic inevitably results in number of alternative interpretations of the problem domain and the modelling tools used in its study. This paper seeks to pull together these strands by proposing a theoretical definition of an urban energy system model and then evaluating the state of current practice. Drawing on a review of 219 papers, five key areas of practice were identified -- technology design, building design, urban climate, systems design, and policy assessment -- each with distinct and incomplete interpretations of the problem domain. We also highlight a sixth field, land use and transportation modelling, which has direct relevance to the use of energy in cities but has been somewhat overlooked by the literature to date. Despite their diversity, these approaches to urban energy system modelling share four common challenges in understanding model complexity, data quality and uncertainty, model integration, and policy relevance. We then examine the opportunities for improving current practice in urban energy systems modelling, focusing on the potential of sensitivity analysis and cloud computing, data collection and integration techniques, and the use of activity-based modelling as an integrating framework. The results indicate that there is significant potential for urban energy systems modelling to move beyond single disciplinary approaches towards a sophisticated integrated perspective that more fully captures the theoretical intricacy of urban energy systems.},

abstract = {The energy consumption of cities strongly influences national energy and climate policy priorities, so improving the efficiency of urban energy systems is an increasingly important issue. Energy is vital to the delivery of urban services and its role can be considered at many stages in the urban design process. It begins with the planning and layout of a new city, through to the socio-economic structure of the city and its activities, and the choice of energy carriers and technologies used to meet these demands. Unfortunately existing modelling technologies typically focus on only one of these components and are customized to a single problem context. We introduce a new tool kit named SynCity for analyzing such integrated urban energy systems and demonstrate it using the case of Shanghai Lingang New City in this paper. The methodology proves to be a powerful tool for assessing potentially convoluted resource chains and offers a promising low-cost solution for eco-city's energy system.},

abstract = {This paper presents a study on the conceptualisations of en- ergy systems which are used in computer modelling. A survey was de- signed and executed, containing questions about the type of energy sys- tems, the scope of the problem, spatial and temporal dimensions of the work as well as software tools, specific conceptualisations and the diffi- culty of obtaining data. 50 responses were received, with people from a wide range of backgrounds and working on different types of problems. Key results show that almost all respondents use computer models and that the overall majority of them wrote or customised their own tools and models, which are generally complex and take weeks to months for a new user to become familiar with. More than two-thirds of the re- spondents claimed that it is either difficult or very difficult to collect the right data and a majority is willing to share input data as well as out- comes of the studies. However, only about half of them indicated that they currently use any shared conceptualisations or ontologies in their work. Analysis of the data reveals that researchers find data collection difficult in almost all circumstances and therefore if a common ontology facilitated easier data access, it could be widely applicable. From the results, we can confirm our hypothesis that there is not yet one widely used ontology for energy systems, and it does not seem likely that a one-size-fits-all solution can be developed. Nevertheless the idea of a generic middle-layer ontology for energy systems, taking into account the standards that people already use in their work, could prove useful to link more detailed schemas and future work will explore how this can be achieved to benefit the larger community.},

abstract = {Urban metabolism is an important technique for understanding the relationship between cities and the wider environment. Such analyses are typically performed at the scale of the whole city and using annual average data, a feature that is driven largely by restrictions in data availability. However in order to assess the resource implications of policy interventions and to design and operate efficient urban infrastructures such as energy systems, greater spatial and temporal resolutions are required in the underlying resource demand data. As this information is rarely available, we propose that these demand profiles might be simulated using activity-based modeling. This is a micro-simulation approach that calculates the activity schedules of individuals within the city and then converts this information into resource demands. The method is demonstrated by simulating electricity and natural gas demands in London and by examining how these non-transport energy demands might change in response to a shift in commuting patterns, for example, in response to a congestion charge or similar policy. The article concludes by discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the approach, as well as highlighting future research directions. Key challenges include the simulation of in-home activities, assessing the transferability of the complex data sets and models supporting such analyses, and determining which aspects of urban metabolism would benefit most from this technique.},

abstract = {Most world cities are now planned in one way or another. Through the deliberate positioning of activity and transportation facilities, urban authorities hope to ensure the success of their cities in economic, social and environmental terms. Urban planning models are an important tool to help them in this task, and in this chapter, we examine the use of optimization techniques in urban planning modelling. Through a broad review of the field, we highlight the distinction between single-goal urban-environment models and multi-objective land use and transportation models. While it is shown that optimization no longer plays a stand-alone role in land use and transportation modelling, it does contribute to the overall modelling workflow. Furthermore, optimization forms the basis of two niche applications: excess commuting and sketch modelling. This last field holds the most promise for the future, enabling planners to establish minimum resource consumption benchmarks for their city as a means of comparison with other cities and to evaluate the ambition and feasibility of new plans.},

abstract = {So far research on modelling the travelling patterns of electric vehicles (EVs) lacks technical depth since the variability of individual travel behaviour lack spatial and temporal disaggregated details - this data is needed by operators (DNOs) to assess EV impact at a low voltage level. Thus, it is essential to integrate issues concerning the mobility of EVs with the operational issues facing DNOs. This paper discusses how a bottom-up agent-based modelling (ABM) approach, addressing the mobility of EVs, can be combined with power flow studies at different levels of abstraction. From the DNOâs perspective the fact that EVs can move around means loads disappear and may reappear at a different location, which has consequences on the power flows. Hence the data collected from the EV driving patterns are quantified to monitor the state of charge of the batteries. Subsequently, the output collected from the ABM simulations are applied to power system studies by incorporating its data into a time coordinated optimal power flow (TCOPF) program. An example proof-of-concept case study is showcased to demonstrate the relevance of the ABM paradigm and the effectiveness of the TCOPF solver when they are merged for a small network; in this fashion proving interoperability between the models. Preliminary results illustrate the valuable operational information utilities can obtain regarding optimal EV charging strategies when considering an ABM approach to represent EVs in power flow studies.},

This paper examines one such development in the UK and considers the role of biomass energy systems. We present an integrated resource modelling framework that identifies an optimized low-cost energy supply system including the choice of conversion technologies, fuel sources, and distribution networks. Our analysis shows that strategies based on imported wood chips, rather than locally converted forestry residues, burned in a mix of ICE and ORC combined heat and power facilities offer the most promise. While there are uncertainties surrounding the precise environmental impacts of these solutions, it is clear that such biomass systems can help eco-towns to meet their target of an 80\% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.},

One promising strategy for delivering these results is to increase the integration of energy services, for example through the use of combined heat and power systems. This paper introduces a tool for analyzing such integrated energy systems and demonstrates it in the case of a UK eco-town supplied with heat and power from biomass sources. We conclude that the methodology is a powerful tool for assessing potentially convoluted resource chains, a common feature of biomass energy strategies. While biomass offers a promising low-carbon solution for eco-towns such as the one studied here, we note that significant uncertainties remain in cost, carbon performance and resource availability.},

Energy is vital to the delivery of urban services and its role can be considered at many stages in the urban design process. This begins with the planning and layout of a new city, through to the socio-economic structure of the city and its activities, and the choice of energy carriers and technologies used to meet these demands. Unfortunately existing modelling technologies typically focus on only one of these components and are customised to a single problem context. We have therefore developed a ï¿½synthetic cityï¿½ tool kit (SynCity) to facilitate the integrated modelling of urban energy systems across all of these design steps and in a variety of problem environments. After outlining the components of this methodology, we demonstrate how it can be applied to the case of a UK eco-town. The discussion then considers the wider applicability of the SynCity methodology and highlights potential use cases.},

abstract = {Purpose ï¿½ The use of cross-cutting urban services (e.g. energy or water) has been proposed as a way of improving the performance of urban sustainability indicators. This paper considers how this service niche approach might be applied to Londonï¿½s energy system. Design/methodology/approach ï¿½ Semi-structured interviews with stakeholders from Londonï¿½s energy policy community are presented. A diffusion of innovation framework is then used to assess how the service niche approach fits with existing practice and consequently whether it is likely to be adopted in practice. Findings ï¿½ The service niche approach resonates with current indicator practice but it cannot overcome barriers such as a lack of political will or resources alone. While the method is therefore unlikely to be adopted as a wholesale replacement for existing strategies, it could be beneficial for complementary assessments. Research limitations/implications ï¿½ A limited sample of six interviewees is presented but by examining other service niches and performing a comparative analysis, the paperï¿½s conclusions could be extended. Practical implications ï¿½ To leverage the full potential of the technique, two expansion strategies are proposed: replication (creating multiple service niche assessments in complementary urban systems) and extrapolation (extending the niche activities of a local policy maker to regional or national levels). Experts could play a central role in coordinating these efforts, collecting relevant data and analysing the aggregate results with policy makers. Originality/value ï¿½ The paper presents a new practical analysis of the service niche approach that should be of interest to both urban managers and urban sustainability researchers.},

abstract = {This paper considers the field of urban energy policy, a neglected yet important topic. Cities account for approximately two-thirds of global primary energy consumption creating significant benefits and costs. As a result there has been growing interest in the contribution of cities to global energy policy issues such as climate change but a number of significant questions remain: e.g.$\backslash$ how do energy policy processes differ between national and urban scales, and how can cities contribute most effectively to global policy goals? We present the results of interviews with key stakeholders within London to illustrate some unique features of the urban energy policy cycle. We then take a wider view, proposing a research agenda with three key goals: describing the global variety of urban energy consumption and policy; understanding the resulting diversity in responsibility, vulnerability and capacity; and developing shared procedures and solutions. Tackling these questions is vital if cities are to contribute fully to current energy policy efforts.},

abstract = {This paper demonstrates a new tool for the integrated modelling of urban energy systems. Energy is vital to the delivery of urban services and its role can be considered at many stages in the urban design process. This begins with the planning and layout of a new city, through to the socio-economic structure of the city and its activities, and the choice of energy carriers and technologies used to meet these demands. Unfortunately existing modelling technologies typically focus on only one of these components and are customised to a single problem context. We have therefore developed a ï¿½synthetic cityï¿½ tool kit (SynCity) to facilitate the integrated modelling of urban energy systems across all of these design steps and in a variety of problem environments. After outlining the components of this methodology, we demonstrate how it can be applied to the case of a UK eco-town. The discussion then considers the wider applicability of the SynCity methodology and highlights potential use cases.},

Many of the technologies involved are well established, but it is only with their increased technical maturity and the imperatives of climate change, energy security and fuel poverty that DETs have been realistically suggested as an integral part of our future built environment. This review will consider the possible physical and behavioural impacts of increased levels of low-carbon decentralised energy, presenting both recent research in this field and an analysis of policy trends and future scenarios.},

abstract = {Microgeneration--the generation of electricity and/or heat within the home--has recently become a notable addition to UK energy policy debates. Specifically research has suggested that, as well as providing renewable energy, these technologies might encourage changes in household energy consumption. The research presented here investigates this `double-dividend' effect using PV households in the UK. It is shown that the installation of PV encouraged households to reduce their overall electricity consumption by approximately 6\% and shift demand to times of peak generation. From a household perspective, system performance monitors had the most notable influence on these behavioural responses; however evolving industry arrangements for metering and microgeneration tariffs will be central in determining the future role of consumers. The paper therefore concludes that the full benefits of microgeneration can only be realised if informed households are integrated within supportive industry and government frameworks.},

abstract = {The sustainability of urban environments is an important issue at both local and international scales. Indicators are frequently used by decision-makers seeking to improve urban performance but these metrics can be dependent on sparse quantitative data. This paper explores the potential of an alternative approach, using an internet search engine to quickly gather qualitative data on the key attributes of cities. The method is applied to 21 world cities and the results indicate that, while the technique does shed light on direct and indirect aspects of sustainability, the validity of derived metrics as objective indicators of long-term sustainability is questionable. However the method's ability to provide subjective short-term assessments is more promising and it could therefore play an important role in participatory policy exercises such as public consultations. A number of promising technical improvements to the method's performance are also highlighted.},

abstract = {Urban sustainability indicators play an important role in helping policy-makers ensure the continued success of their cities. However, a review of current practice suggests that priority is often given to the measurability and policy relevance of these metrics. Their analytical validity - i.e. their ability to act as meaningful representations of the urban system and thus inform appropriate policy responses - is less certain. An examination of London's USIs confirms this gap between theory and practice and identifies vague definitions of urban sustainability as part of the problem. A ?service niche? approach to indicator selection is therefore outlined, using pervasive goal-oriented urban services such as energy or water systems to guide the selection of policy-relevant interconnected metrics. Strategies for expanding such niches to wider assessments of urban sustainability are also discussed. Copyright Â© 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.},
