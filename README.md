# kmm-Vita

This is my (work in progress migrating from the default jk-vita) academic CV, built on the excellent work of:

- [James Keirstead](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/j.keirstead)'s [jk-vita](https://github.com/jkeirstead/jk-vita)
- [Kieran Healy](https://github.com/kjhealy/kjh-vita)
- [Rob Hyndman](http://robjhyndman.com/research/cv.sty)

I added a bash script to automatically build the CV.
