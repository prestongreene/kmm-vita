jk-vita 0.2.0 (4 March 2015)
---------------------------

* A complete redesign of the CV.  The basic idea is to separate
  content and style.  CV data is stored in YAML files, with
  publication data in a bibtex database.  A series of R functions then
  build this into a LaTeX source document, which is compiled using a
  specific style file.  See README.md for more details and examples.

* Publications database has been updated with latest from Mendeley.

* One-page, two-page, and publications documents have been removed
  temporarily and will be restored in the next version.
